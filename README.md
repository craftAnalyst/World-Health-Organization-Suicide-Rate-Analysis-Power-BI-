# World Health Organization Suicide Rate Analysis [Power BI]  
This data analysis project uses Power BI to provide insightful dashboard and report to aid in the prevention of suicidal factors and reduction of suicide rates.

I was provided with a dataset by the World Health Organization (WHO) on global suicide rates to analyze and present at Aitech Abuja. The dataset included information on country, year, sex,
age, number of suicides, population, suicides per 100,000 population, GDP, GDP per capita, and generation. My task was to analyze this data using visualizations in Microsoft Power BI and
report my findings based on specific questions.

## Key Findings:  
▪️Total Suicides (1985-2016): Over the last 32 years, the total number of suicides was 7 million, with 5 million males and 2 million females.  
▪️The total GDP during this period was $516.66 trillion, the total GDP per capita was $469.23 million, and the total population was 51 billion.  
▪️Countries with the Highest and Lowest Suicide Rates: The country with the highest suicide rate was the Russian Federation, with 1.21 million suicides, followed by the United States (1.03
million), Japan (0.81 million), and France (0.33 million).  The countries with the lowest suicide rates (0.01 million) included New Zealand, Slovakia, Uruguay, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Ireland,
Greece, El Salvador, Israel, Slovenia, Turkey, Singapore, Puerto Rico, Turkmenistan, Guatemala, South Africa, Estonia, and Costa Rica.  
▪️Regional Analysis: Asia had the highest suicide rates, while Africa recorded the lowest.  
▪️Gender and Generational Impact: Males were the most affected, with suicides peaking among Boomers and at their lowest in Generation Z. For females, the highest rates were in the
Silent Generation and the lowest in Millennials.  
▪️Trends Over Time (1985-2016): From 1985 to 1987, suicides increased from 116,063 to 126,842, then dropped to 121,026 in 1988. There was a gradual increase, peaking at 246,725 in
1996, followed by fluctuations until 2015. In 2016, there was a drastic decline, dropping from 203,640 to 15,603.  
▪️Correlation Between Suicide Rate and GDP Per Capita: The analysis showed an inverse relationship between suicide rates and GDP per capita: as GDP per capita increased, suicide
rates tended to decrease, and vice versa.  

## Proposed Solutions:  
Based on these findings, I propose the following actions;  
• Global Mental Health Campaigns: Launch mental health awareness campaigns to reduce stigma and encourage individuals to seek help.  
• Improve Mental Health Services: Enhance mental health services worldwide by providing better access to mental health education and support systems.  
• Prevention Strategies: Implement strategies to limit access to harmful materials such as pesticides and firearms.  
• Strengthen Emergency Support Systems: Improve crisis intervention services and provide more comprehensive emergency support.  
• Economic and Social Policies: Develop policies that promote economic stability, foster job growth, support small-scale businesses, and facilitate skills acquisition to help reduce stressors
contributing to suicide.
